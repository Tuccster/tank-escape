# tank-escape
A game inspired by the likes of Wii Play Tanks

*This project is more or less abandon*

# How far did this project get?
Not terribly far as this project didn't make it past a basic prototype stage, although the systems that I got working I spent weeks fine tuning and making sure they felt right. 

GameObject Inheritance was something new that I tried with this project; I make both the enemy tanks and player tank use the same base Tank class, for identical movement and area accessibility. Additionally, I tried to create custom behaviours for each enemy tank type.
